This is an opinionated tutorial, aiming to streamline the process at the
expense of some flexibility.

Assumptions:

* We assume the project will be support that last two minor releases of Python.
  (As of this writing, that's Python 3.6 and Python 3.7.) Python 2 is near its
  scheduled end of life, and Python 3 has
  `many well-documented benefits <https://python-3-for-scientists.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  for scientific applications.
* We integrate with GitHub, Travis-CI, and GitHub Pages. We welcome
  pull-requests to generalize to other services, provided that the process for
  users remains streamlined.
