Overview of a Device
********************

Signals and Devices
===================

* A **Signal** represents a single value. In EPICS, it corresponds to either
  a single read-only PV or a pair of read and write PVs, grouped together.
* A **Device** is composed of Signals or of other Devices. Devices can be
  nested. Some devices map to single pieces of hardware (like a motor).
  Others group together many different pieces of hardware (like a
  diffractometer).
* In one process, the same PVs might appear in multiple different Devices,
  so organized for different uses.

Staging
=======

When a Device ``d`` is used in scan, it is "staged" and "unstaged." Think of
this as "setup" and "cleanup". That is, before a device is triggered, read, or
moved, the scan is expected to call ``d.stage()``. And, at the end of scan,
``d.unstage()`` is called. (Whenever possible, unstaging is performed even if
the scan is aborted or fails due to an error.)

The staging process is a "hook" for preparing a device for use. To add
custom staging logic to a Device, subclass it and override ``stage`` and/or
``unstage`` like so.

.. code-block:: python

    class MyMotor(EpicsMotor):

        def stage(self):
            print('I am staging.')
            super().stage()

        def unstage(self):
            print('I am unstaging.')
            super().unstage()

It is crucial to call ``super()``, as above, so that any built-in staging
behavior is not overridden.

A common use for staging is to set certain signals to certain values for
a scan and then set them back at the end. For example, a detector device
might turn on "capture mode" at the beginning of the scan and then flip it
back off (or back to its original setting, whatever that was) at the end.
For this, ophyd provides a convenience, ``stage_sigs`` --- a dictionary
mapping signals to desired values. The device reads the initial values
of these signals, stashes them, changes them to the desired value, and then
restore the initial value when the device is unstaged. It is best to
customize ``stage_sigs`` in the device's ``__init__`` method, like so:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyMotor(EpicsMotor):
        def __init__(*args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
            self.stage_sigs[self.user_offset] = 5

When a ``MyMotor`` device is staged, its ``user_offset`` value will be set
to 5. When it is unstaged, it will be set back to whatever value it had
right before it was staged.


Device API
==========


All Devices have certain methods and attributes in common.

.. autoclass:: ophyd.Device

High-level Interface (used by bluesky)
======================================

.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.read
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.describe
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.set
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.trigger
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.stage
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.unstage
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.configure
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.read_configuration
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.describe_configuration

Low-level Interface (for exploration, debugging)
================================================

.. autoattribute:: ophyd.Device.connected

   ``True`` is all components are connected, ``False`` if any are not

.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.wait_for_connection
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.get
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.put
.. automethod:: ophyd.Device.get_device_tuple
