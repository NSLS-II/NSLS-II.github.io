Data Broker
===========

The databroker Python package provides a simple, user-friendly interface
for retrieving stored data and metadata from multiple sources. It loads the
data into memory as built-in Python data types and numpy arrays.

It is intended to be used in conjunction with the
`bluesky <https://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky>`_ data collection framework, but
it is an independent project that can be used separately if desired.
