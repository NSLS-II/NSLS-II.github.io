        "\n# Anderson impurity model for NiO XAS\nHere we calculate the $L$-edge XAS spectrum of an Anderson impurity model,\nwhich is sometimes also called a charge-transfer multiplet model. This model\nconsiders a set of correlated orbitals, often called the impurity or metal\nstates, that hybridize with a set of uncorrelated orbitals, often called the\nligands or bath states. Everyone's favorite test case for x-ray spectroscopic\ncalculations of the Anderson impurity model is NiO and we won't risk being\noriginal! This means that our correlated states will\nbe the Ni $3d$ orbitals and the uncorrelated states come from O\n$2p$ orbitals. The fact that we include these interactions means that our\nspectrum can include processes where electrons transition from the bath to the\nimpurity, as such the Anderson Impurity Model is often more accurate than atomic\nmodels, especially if the material has strong covalency.\n\nWhen defining the bath states, it is useful to use the so-called\nsymmetry adapted linear combinations of orbitals as the basis. These states\ntake into account the symmetry relationships between the different bath atom\norbitals and the fact that there are bath orbital combinations that do not\ninteract with the impurity by symmetry. By doing this the problem can be\nrepresented with fewer orbitals, which makes the calculation far more efficient.\nThe standard EDRIXS solver that we will use assumes that the bath states are\nrepresented by an integer number of bath sites set by :code:`nbath`, each of\nwhich hosts the same number of spin-orbits as the impurity e.g. 10 for a\n$d$-electron material.\n\nNiO has a rocksalt structure in which all Ni atoms are surrounded by six O\natoms. This NiO cluster used to simulate the\ncrystal would then contain 10 Ni $3d$ spin-orbitals and $6$\nspin-orbitals per O $\\times 6$ O atoms $=36$ oxygen\nspin-orbitals. As explained by, for example, Maurits Haverkort\net al. in [1]_ symmetry allows us to represent the bath with 10 symmetry\nadapted linear combinations of the different O $p_x, p_y, p_z$ states.\nThe crystal field and hopping parameters for\nsuch a calculation can be obtained by post-processing DFT calculations. We will\nuse values for NiO from [1]_. If you use values from a paper the relevant\nreferences should, of course, be cited.\n"
