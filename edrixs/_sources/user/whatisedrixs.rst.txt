****************

EDRIXS is an open source toolkit for simulating XAS and RIXS spectra based on exact diagonalization of model Hamiltonians.
It was started as part of `COMSCOPE project <https://www.bnl.gov/comscope/software/comsuite.php/>`_ in the
Center for Computational Material Spectroscopy and Design, Brookhaven National Laboratory and is now maintained and 
developed in collaboration between the `Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science Division <https://www.bnl.gov/cmpmsd/>`_
and the `National Syncrotron Light Source II <https://www.bnl.gov/nsls2/>`_.
