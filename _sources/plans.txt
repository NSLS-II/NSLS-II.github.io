Plans
=====

An experimental procedure is represented as a sequence of granular
instructions. In bluesky, each instruction is called a *message* and a sequence
of instructions is called a *plan*.

The plans are organized like a burger menu. A variety of fully-assembled plans
are provided --- just as you might order the All-American Burger or The Hog
Wild Burger. But you can also build your own plan by mixing the ingredients
to make something original.

(For developers: what we are calling a "plan" is not actually a special data
structure. It is typically a generator, but it can be any iterable or iterator
--- a list, for example. The messages in a plan are ``Msg`` objects, a
namedtuple.)

Basic Usage
-----------

Before we begin, we'll make a RunEngine to execute our plans.

**This RunEngine is not set up to save any data.** You may already have a
RunEngine instance, ``RE``, defined in an IPython profile. If ``RE`` is already
defined, do not redefine it. Just skip to the next step.

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky import RunEngine
    RE = RunEngine({})


Execute the a ``count`` plan, which reads one or more detectors.

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky.plans import count
    from bluesky.examples import det  # a simulated detector
    RE(count([det]))

It worked, but the data was not displayed. This time, send the output
``LiveTable``.

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky.callbacks import LiveTable
    RE(count([det]), LiveTable([det]))

Combining Plans
---------------

Plans are iterables (roughly speaking, lists) and the Python language has nice
facilities for handling them. For example to join to plans together, use

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.examples import motor, det
    from bluesky.plans import scan, sleep, pchain

    master_plan = pchain(scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 3),
                         sleep(),
                         scan([det], motor, 5, 10, 2)

    RE(master_plan)

This has advantages over executing them in sequence like so:

.. code-block:: python

    # Don't do this.
    RE(plan1); RE(plan2)

If there are no interruptions or errors, these two methods are equivalent. But
in the event of a problem, the RunEngine can do more to recover if it
maintains control. In the second example, it loses control between completing
``plan1`` and beginning ``plan2``.

What if want to ``print`` or do other activities between executing the plans?
There is another way to combine plans to accomodate this.

.. code-block:: python


    def make_master_plan():
        plan1 = scan([det1, det2], motor, 1, 5, 10)
        plan2 = relative_scan([det1], motor, 5, 10, 10)

        yield from plan1
        print('plan1 is finished -- moving onto plan2')
        yield from plan2

    RE(make_master_plan())  # note the ()

Arbitrary Python code can go inside ``master_plan``. It could employ ``if``
blocks, ``for`` loops -- anything except a ``return`` statement. If you want to
know more about what is happening here, structures like this in Python are
called *generators*.

Here are a couple more useful recipes:

.. code-block:: python

    "Run plan1, wait for user confirmation, then run plan2."

    def make_master_plan():
        plan1 = scan([det1, det2], motor, 1, 5, 10)
        plan2 = relative_scan([det1], motor, 5, 10, 10)

        yield from plan1
        # pause and consult the user
        if input('continue? (y/n)') != 'y':
            raise StopIteration
        yield from plan2

.. code-block:: python

    "Run a plan several times, changing the step size each time."

    def make_master_plan():
        for num in range(5, 10):
            # Change the number of steps in the plan in each loop
            plan1 = scan([det1, det2], motor, 1, 5, num)
            yield from plan1

Plan Context Managers
---------------------

These context managers provide a sunninct, readable syntax for inserting plans
before and after other plans.

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree:

    baseline_context
    monitor_context
    subs_context
    run_context
    event_context
    stage_context

For example, the ``baseline_context`` reads a list of detectors at the
beginning and end of an experiment.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import baseline_context, count
    from bluesky.examples import det

    plans = []
    with baseline_context(plans, [det]):
        plans.append(count([det]))

Use with the ``planify`` decorator to join the list of plans into one plan.

.. code-block:: python

    from bluesky.plans import planify

    @planify
    def count_with_baseline_readings():
        plans = []
        with baseline_context(plans, [det]):
            plans.append(count([det]))
        return plans

Plan Preprocessors
------------------

These "preprocessors" take in a plan and modify its contents on the fly.
For example, ``relative_set`` rewrites all positions to be relative to the
initial position.

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree:

    finalize_wrapper
    subs_wrapper
    inject_md_wrapper
    run_wrapper
    monitor_during_wrapper
    fly_during_wrapper
    baseline_wrapper
    relative_set_wrapper
    reset_positions_wrapper
    lazily_stage_wrapper


These wrappers operate on a generator *instance*. There are corresponding
functions that operate on a generator *function*. They are named
``*_decorator``, corresponding to each ``*_wrapper`` above.

.. code-block:: python

    def relative_scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num):
        absolute = scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num)
        relative = relative_set(absolute, [motor])
        yield from relative

Or, equivalently, using the ``planify`` decorator:

.. code-block:: python

    @planify
    def relative_scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num):
        absolute = scan(detectors, motor, start, stop, num)
        relative = relative_set(absolute, [motor])
        return [relative]

Object-Oriented Standard Plans
------------------------------

These provide a different way of using the standard plans. The plan becomes
a reusable object, whose parameters can be adjusted interactively between
uses.

.. ipython:: python

    from bluesky.plans import Scan
    from bluesky.examples import motor, det, det3
    plan = Scan([det], motor, 1, 5, 10)
    RE(plan)
    RE(plan)

Any of the plan's parameters can be updated individually.

.. ipython:: python

    plan.num = 4  # change number of data points from 10 to 4
    RE(plan)
    plan.detectors.append(det3)  # add another detector
    RE(plan)

The ``set`` method is a convenient way to update multiple parameters at once.

.. ipython:: python

    plan.set(start=20, stop=25)

.. autosummary::
   :nosignatures:
   :toctree:

    Count
    Scan
    RelativeScan
