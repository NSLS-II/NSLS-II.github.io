"""
Use scans with adaptive step sizes
**********************************

Problem
=======

Concentrate measurement in regions of high variability, taking larger strides
through flat regions.

Approach
========

The *plans* in bluesky can be fully adaptive, determining one step at a time.
A couple built-in plans provide this capability out of the box.

Example Solution
================

The :func:`bluesky.plans.adaptive_scan` aims to maintain a certain delta in y
between successive steps through x. After each step, it accounts for the local
derivative and adjusts it step size accordingly. If it misses by a large
margin, it takes a step backward (if allowed).
