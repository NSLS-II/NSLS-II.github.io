"""
Scan a grid around each sample in a grid
****************************************

Problem
=======

Examples are arranged on a substrate. There are two motors, x and y, for moving
a detector over the subtrate. Scan a grid of readings around the center
position of each sample.

Approach
========

Specify the samples and their arrangement as a mapping of sample names to
(x, y) positions, like ``{'A': (1, 1), 'B': (1, 2)}``. Write a custom plan that
loops through the samples. For each sample, move to sample's center position
and perform a :func:`bluesky.plans.relative_outer_product_scan` (i.e., grid
scan) around that position. For each sample, one run will be saved. Include the
sample name in the metadata.

Example Solution
