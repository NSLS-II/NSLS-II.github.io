Overview
--------

amostra is a sample management service for scientific experiments. It is implemented as a web service with a RESTful api. Amostra is not a data acquisition tool that controls robots etc. It keeps track of an experiment/run's samples, sample groups(containers), and requests that act on these samples. The full amostra collection suit is available but optional for every beamline or application. Flexible No-SQL nature allows storing semi structured sample information (which I have proven works in every beamline so far). Amostra can be coupled with 3rd party applications such as sample management hardware(e.g. robots), PASS system, or csv import/export utility libraries.

The service comes with both an online api that communicates with the amostra service server and a local api that is capable of performing similar tasks offline(locally). The goal of this approach is to provide users with the ability to perform sample management tasks similar to their beamline environment when they have no access to amostra server.
The flexible No-SQL nature allows storing semi structured sample information. What is meant by semi-structured?

Sample, Container, and Request documents all expect certain required fields such as time, uid, name, etc. and user can define any additional fields that the values of these fields can be string, array, document, or array of documents. I hide some of the complexity of semi-structured documents from the end user on the server by defaulting the required values to their appropriate values. If preferred, the user can define these parameters himself/herself. This is intended for those those that have existing tools -which use some other convention- or would like to build their own convention by populating these with values that make more sense for their experiment.

Relationships among collections are made available for any application to utilize and all relationships are completely optional. For instance, a beamline that is interested in this service for solely keeping track of their samples and have only one container, can use the **SampleReference** client, leaving **container** field empty. On the other hand, if an experiment has various containers, samples, and requests that are meaningful to some external source (either daq or analysis), one can use all three collections, using the relationships defined by this service. I talk about how these relationships can be utilized in the Schema section below. In addition to this, you could take a quick look at tutorial section for code examples.


Schema
------

Sample
******

The sample collection provides users with tools to save/restore/query attributes of their samples. Given the flexible nature of the service, users can add their own metadata in any hierarchical order. Amostra provides means to insert both a single sample and a list of samples. Validation is done on the server side for the online api, protecting users from issues that might arise due to schema changes.

Below is the jsonschema model for the sample documents. In case you are not familiar with jsonschema, please see http://json-schema.org/

Sample documents is intended to be the primary location to hold any sort of metadata for samples, prior to an experiment. It is not intended as a service to store experimental results as amostra belongs to the data acquisition stack. One can link amostra and its document to metadataservice and filestore. For storing experimental results on samples, please check https://github.com/nsls-ii/analysisstore.git

Sample documents only require time, uid, and name fields. The client apis can fill in all this information except for the name. project, beamline_id, owner, and any additional kwargs can be used to keep track of samples. container is intended as an optional foreign key and it is the uid of the container document that contains the sample. In other words, container field highlights whether this sample document belongs to any container(physical or virtual group) using a containerâ€™s uid field. One sample can belong to a single group as of release one, however this might change based on user requirements.

kwargs can be any name value pair including lists and nested dicts. The only limit enforced for a document is the 16 MB limit per document.

        },
        "beamline_id": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The beamline ID"
        },

            "type": "number",
            "description": "Time the sample was created.  Unix epoch time"
        },
        "uid": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Globally unique ID for tihs run"
        },

            "description": "String identifier that denotes the owner of this sample. Process/project/user"
        },
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Sample name!"
        },
        "container": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Name of the container/group sample is contained within.Can be virtual or real. Sparsely indexed, not required"
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "uid",
        "time",
        "name"
     ],
    "type": "object",
    "description": "Document created for a single sample"
    }

Container
*********

Container documents are intended for grouping samples either physically or virtually. A physical container can be a puck, dewar, etc. while a virtual group can be anything defined by the user. Similar to samples, a container has time and uid as its required fields. Unlike a sample, name of the container is optional. This is due to the fact that most beamlines do not necessarily have more that a single container and it would be unnecessary to deal with this field every time an entry is created. Please note that name field is still part of the container documents but as an optional field, alongside owner, content, and kind. Similar to samples or most of metadataservice header documents, kwargs can be used to add any additional metadata or external relationship.

One can also define container of containers, where a container can encapsulate another container within itself. This can be done simply by setting the container field of any container document to the uid of the container field.


.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    "properties": {
        "uid": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Globally unique ID for this container"
        },
        "owner": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "String descriptor to associate this request with. Can be user or process"
        },
        "time": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Time the container was created.  Unix epoch time"
        },
        "kind": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Type of the container"
        },
        "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Container name"
        },
        "content": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": {
                "type": "string"
            },
            "description": "The items of this container"
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "uid",
        "time"
     ],
    "type": "object",
    "description": "Document created for group of containers."
    }


Request
*********

Request documents are intended as means to keep track of a set of operations to be performed on a sample. This means, samples and requests have a one-to-many relationship. Requests have three required fields: uid, time, and sample. The operations that user desires to perform. Users can use the state field in order to activate/de-activate requests on samples. The requests can be thought of human-friendly/readable plans.



.. code-block:: javascript

    {
    "properties": {
        "project": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Name of project that this request is part of"
        },
        "beamline_id": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "The beamline ID"
        },
        "time": {
            "type": "number",
            "description": "Time request created.  Unix epoch time"
        },
        "uid": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Globally unique ID for this request"
        },
        "owner": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "String descriptor to associate this request with. Can be user or process"
        },
        "sample": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "sample uid. samples are unaware of requests but requests know about samples"
        }
    },
    "required": [
        "uid",
        "time",
        "sample"
     ],
    "type": "object",
    "description": "Document created for a single request."
    }
