Cookbook
========

These are complete, working examples meant as a starting point for
customization by the user. They illustrate some of the range of what is
possible.

For intermediate or advanced Python programmers, this section may be the right
starting point to quickly get up to speed on bluesky. For newcomers to the
language, these examples are probably not the right places to start: we
recommend at least skimming the previous sections, where the various components
of bluesky are introduced methodically and with more prose commentary.

As you can see, this section is a work in progress. This list of examples will
grow in the coming weeks.
