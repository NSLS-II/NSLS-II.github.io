Life Sciences Data Collection
=============================

LSDC is an application for data acquisition on the macromolecular crystallography (MX) beamlines at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) in Upton, NY, USA. Its features include:

* Sample handling - sample information entry and handling can be done.
* Sample centering - both manual and automated methods for initial sample centering to the visual beam location and rotation axis are used.
* Data collection - standard oscillation, vector, rastering, and energy scans are the primary experiments.
* Data processing - processing of data collected in experiments is triggered.
